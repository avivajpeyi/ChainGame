This game was a submission for [Mix and Game Jam (2019)](https://itch.io/jam/mix-and-game-jam). 
This jam's theme was:

```
DIMENSION CHANGE
Take a game mechanic from one dimension and recreate it in another
```
We decided to take the `dead eye` mechanic from Red Dead Redemption, and put it into a 2D game.
